# JavaScript Exercises

## Getting started

1. Create a new repository in your github account called `javascript-exercises`

2. Clone this project:

`git clone https://github.com/codelex-io/javascript-exercises`

3. Change project origin to your repository:

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/{username}/javascript-exercises.git`

4. Push changes:

`git push -u origin master`

5. Pull dependencies:

`npm install`

## Setup automated build for each pull request

Each pull request must be validated to ensure that all tests are passing and the code is properly formatted.

Visit [*Azure pipelines* @github.com/marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines) and complete free plan setup for your repository.

When you will have an account created there, you may access *Azure Pipelines*

### Setup pipeline for your repository

1. Create new pipeline

## Executing tests

To execute all tests:

`npm run test`

To execute a single test:

`npm run test exercises/easy/Anagrams`

## Submit an assignment

Before submitting any of the assignments, create a new branch with appropriate name:

`git checkout -b {branch-name}`

When all of the needed tests are passing, push the changes and create a pull request to your teacher:

`git push origin {branch-name}`

### Easy (branch name: easy)

In the [azure-pipelines.yml](./azure-pipelines.yml) which is located in the root of your repository, make sure that third line under *script* is uncommented and contains following command:

`docker run javascript-exercises:latest run test:easy`

### Medium (branch name: medium)

Add following command in [azure-pipelines.yml](./azure-pipelines.yml):

`docker run javascript-exercises:latest run test:medium`

And add appropriate script in [package.json](./package.json) file.

## Handling example project updates

1. Make sure that you have committed all your changes.

2. Switch remote to the original repository:

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/codelex-io/javascript-exercises.git`

3. Fetch latest changes:

`git pull`

4. Switch remote back to your repository:

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/{username}/javascript-exercises.git`
