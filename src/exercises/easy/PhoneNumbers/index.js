/**
 * Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.
 *
 * The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is a telephone numbering system used by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda. All NANP-countries share the same international country code: 1.
 *
 * NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan Area code, commonly known as area code, followed by a seven-digit local number. The first three digits of the local number represent the exchange code, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the subscriber number.
 *
 * The format is usually represented as:
 *
 *      (NXX)-NXX-XXXX
 *
 * where N is any digit from 2 through 9 and X is any digit from 0 through 9.
 *
 * Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing punctuation and the country code (1) if present.
 *
 * For example, the inputs:
 *
 *      +1 (613)-995-0253
 *      613-995-0253
 *      1 613 995 0253
 *      613.995.0253
 *
 * should all produce the output:
 *
 *      6139950253
 *
 * Note: As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.
